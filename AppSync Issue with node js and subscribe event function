Here are some steps you can follow to set up your subscription properly:
Import the API and graphqlOperation modules from aws-amplify in your JavaScript file:

import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
Define the subscription query by creating a GraphQL subscription document using the gql tag function:

const subscriptionQuery = gql`
    subscription SubscribeToChannel($channelName: String!) {
        subscribe(channelName: $channelName) {
            data
            name
        }
    }
`;

Use the API.graphql method to subscribe to the AppSync endpoint with the subscription query:

const subscription = API.graphql(graphqlOperation(subscriptionQuery, { channelName: channelName })).subscribe({
    next: (data) => {
        console.log('New data received:', data);
    },
    error: (error) => {
        console.error('Subscription error:', error);
    }
});

In this code, the API.graphql method takes two arguments: the GraphQL subscription operation, and an object containing any variables needed for the subscription. 
The subscribe method returns a subscription object that you can use to unsubscribe from the subscription when needed.
