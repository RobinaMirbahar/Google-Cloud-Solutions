The BigQuery API is to get the list of users, groups, and service accounts who have access to a specific table, along with the columns they have access to. 

Example Python code that uses the BigQuery API to get this information:

from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Set the credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    filename='.../key.json',
    scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'])

# Set the project ID and dataset ID
project_id = 'your-project-id'
dataset_id = 'your-dataset-id'

# Set the table ID
table_id = 'your-table-id'

# Create the BigQuery client
client = bigquery.Client(project=project_id, credentials=credentials)

# Get the table reference
table_ref = client.dataset(dataset_id).table(table_id)

# Get the table metadata
table = client.get_table(table_ref)

# Get the table access control list
acl = table.acl

# Print the users, groups, and service accounts who have access to the table
for entry in acl:
    print(entry.entity_type, entry.entity_id, entry.role)
    
    # Get the columns that the user/group/service account has access to
    for col_acl in entry.get('access', []):
        print('  ', col_acl.column_name, col_acl.role)
        
The provided code leverages the bigquery.Client object to retrieve the metadata associated with a particular table. Subsequently, it fetches the access control list 
for the table by utilizing the acl property.Afterwards, it iterates through each entry in the access control list and displays the type of entity (such as user, group, or service account),
the corresponding entity ID (email address or service account ID), and the role assigned to that entity for the table.
